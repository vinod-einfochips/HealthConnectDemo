# Health Connect Permission Dialog Fix

## Issue
Health Connect permission dialog was not opening automatically when the app started.

## Root Cause
The Health Connect permission request was only triggered after body sensor permissions were successfully granted. If body sensors were already granted or if the flow was interrupted, Health Connect permissions were never requested.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Flow on Startup**
```kotlin
checkAndRequestBodySensorPermissions()
    ↓
[If body sensors needed] → Request them
    ↓
[Always] → Request Health Connect permissions
```

### 2. **Smart Button Behavior**
When user clicks "Check/Request Permissions":
- If body sensors already granted → Directly open Health Connect
- If body sensors not granted → Request body sensors first, then Health Connect

### 3. **Smooth Transition**
Added 300ms delay between dialogs to ensure smooth UI transition:
```kotlin
Handler(Looper.getMainLooper()).postDelayed({
    requestHealthPermissions.launch(viewModel.permissions)
}, 300)
```

### 4. **Error Handling**
Added try-catch to handle any issues opening Health Connect:
```kotlin
try {
    requestHealthPermissions.launch(viewModel.permissions)
} catch (e: Exception) {
    Toast.makeText(this, "Error opening Health Connect", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
}
```

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Fresh Install
1. Install app
2. Grant body sensor permissions
3. **Health Connect dialog should open automatically**
4. Grant Health Connect permissions
5. Both status indicators should show "Granted ✓"

### Test 2: Body Sensors Already Granted
1. Grant body sensors in system settings
2. Open app
3. **Health Connect dialog should open immediately**
4. Grant permissions
5. Status should update

### Test 3: Manual Permission Request
1. Open app
2. Click "Check/Request Permissions" button
3. If body sensors granted → Health Connect opens directly
4. If not → Body sensors requested first, then Health Connect

### Test 4: Permission Denial
1. Deny body sensor permissions
2. Health Connect dialog should still open
3. Can grant Health Connect even if body sensors denied

## Expected Behavior

✅ **On App Launch:**
- Body sensor permission dialog appears
- After granting/denying → Health Connect dialog appears automatically

✅ **On Permission Button Click:**
- Intelligently requests only needed permissions
- Always ensures Health Connect dialog opens

✅ **Status Display:**
- Shows separate status for Body Sensors and Health Connect
- Updates in real-time after permission changes

## Files Modified

1. **MainActivity.kt**
   - Added `requestHealthConnectPermissions()` method
   - Modified body sensor callback to always request Health Connect
   - Added smart logic to permission button
   - Added delay and error handling

2. **Flow Changes**
   ```
   OLD: Body Sensors → [If granted] → Health Connect
   NEW: Body Sensors → [Always] → Health Connect
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Health Connect Still Not Opening

**Check 1: Health Connect Installed**
```bash
adb shell pm list packages | grep healthdata
```
Should show: `com.google.android.apps.healthdata`

**Check 2: Permissions in Manifest**
Verify these are present:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.health.READ_BODY_TEMPERATURE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.health.WRITE_BODY_TEMPERATURE" />
```

**Check 3: Queries Declaration**
```xml
<queries>
    <package android:name="com.google.android.apps.healthdata" />
</queries>
```

**Check 4: Logcat**
```bash
adb logcat | grep -i "health\|permission"
```
Look for any errors related to Health Connect

### Manual Testing

Open Health Connect directly:
```bash
adb shell am start -n com.google.android.apps.healthdata/.MainActivity
```

## Success Indicators

✅ Health Connect dialog opens after body sensor flow
✅ Can grant Health Connect permissions
✅ Status shows "Health Connect: Granted ✓"
✅ Can record temperature successfully
✅ Data appears in Health Connect app
