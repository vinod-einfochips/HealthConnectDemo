# Quick Permission Guide

## What Changed?

### ✅ Removed
- Body sensor permission code
- Automatic permission dialogs on app launch
- `tvBodySensorStatus` UI element

### ✅ Added
- Smart permission checking (only shows dialog when needed)
- Dynamic button text based on permission status
- Cleaner, simpler UI

## How It Works Now

### App Launch
```
1. App opens
2. Checks if Health Connect is available
3. Silently checks permission status
4. Updates UI (no dialogs shown)
```

### Granting Permissions
```
1. User clicks "Grant Permissions" button
2. If already granted → Shows toast "Permissions already granted"
3. If not granted → Shows dialog to open Health Connect
4. User clicks "Open Health Connect"
5. Redirected to Health Connect app
6. User grants permissions
7. Returns to app → Permissions auto-checked → UI updated
```

## UI States

### Permission Status Text
- **"Health Connect: Granted ✓"** - Permissions are granted
- **"Health Connect: Not Granted"** - Permissions need to be granted

### Button Text
- **"Grant Permissions"** - Click to grant permissions
- **"Permissions Granted"** - Permissions already granted

## Code Reference

### Check Permissions (Silent)
```kotlin
override fun onResume() {
    super.onResume()
    viewModel.checkPermissions() // Silent check, no dialogs
}
```

### Request Permissions (User Action)
```kotlin
binding.btnCheckPermissions.setOnClickListener {
    requestHealthConnectPermissions() // Shows dialog only if needed
}
```

### Permission Logic
```kotlin
private fun requestHealthConnectPermissions() {
    viewModel.checkPermissions()
    if (viewModel.permissionStatus.value == false) {
        showHealthConnectPermissionDialog() // Only if not granted
    } else {
        Toast.makeText(this, "Permissions already granted", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
    }
}
```

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: First Launch (No Permissions)
1. Launch app
2. Should see: "Health Connect: Not Granted"
3. Button should say: "Grant Permissions"
4. No dialogs should appear automatically

### Test Scenario 2: Granting Permissions
1. Click "Grant Permissions" button
2. Dialog appears
3. Click "Open Health Connect"
4. Grant permissions in Health Connect
5. Return to app
6. Should see: "Health Connect: Granted ✓"
7. Button should say: "Permissions Granted"

### Test Scenario 3: Already Granted
1. Launch app (with permissions already granted)
2. Should see: "Health Connect: Granted ✓"
3. Click "Permissions Granted" button
4. Should see toast: "Permissions already granted"
5. No dialog appears

## Troubleshooting

### Dialog shows on every launch
- ❌ This should NOT happen anymore
- ✅ Dialog only shows when button is clicked AND permissions are denied

### Permissions not updating
- Check onResume() is calling viewModel.checkPermissions()
- Make sure observeViewModel() is set up correctly

### Button text not changing
- Check observeViewModel() has the button text update logic
- Verify LiveData observer is working

## Benefits

1. **Better UX** - No annoying dialogs on launch
2. **Cleaner Code** - Removed unnecessary body sensor code
3. **Simpler Flow** - Only Health Connect permissions
4. **User Control** - User decides when to grant permissions
5. **Smart UI** - Button text changes based on status

## Summary

The app now has a much better permission flow:
- ✅ No automatic dialogs
- ✅ Permission dialog only when user clicks button
- ✅ Dialog only shows if permissions not granted
- ✅ Clean, simple UI
- ✅ Better user experience
